## Multiple Remotes

```text
# Set the two separated remotes
   git remote add <Name Remote-1> [Remote-1 URL]
   git remote add <Name Remote-2> [Remote-2 URL]

# Set a main common remote called origin
   git remote add origin [Remote-1 URL]

# Set push to main remote
   git remote set-url --add --push origin [Remote-1 URL]

# Set push to Second remote
   git remote set-url --add --push origin [Remote-2 URL]

# To push on both remotes at the same time
   git push origin

# Now, the origin remote fetches from [Remote-1 URL], 
# and pushes to both the [Remote-1 URL] and [Remote-2 URL] repositories.

   git remote show origin

# Set the default configured remote for your current branch

   git branch --set-upstream-to [remote]/[branch]

# Set the default remote repository for the branch 'branch_name'

   git branch [branch_name] --set-upstream-to [remote]/[branch]

# To pull from a specific remote

   git pull <Name Remote-1>

# It is not possible to git pull from multiple repos. 
# However, you can git fetch from multiple repos with
# the following command:

   git fetch --all

# This will fetch information from all remote repos. 
# You can switch to the latest version of a branch 
# on a particular remote with the command:

# Checkout the branch you want to work with.

   git checkout BRANCH

# Reset the branch to match the state as on a specific remote.

   git reset --hard REMOTE-ID/BRANCH

```
